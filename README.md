📘 Detailed Project Description
This project presents a complete Sales & Inventory Tracking System built using Microsoft Excel (with VBA automation) and Power BI. It demonstrates how spreadsheet-driven workflows can be automated and visualized using interactive dashboards — suitable for business users, managers, and analysts.

✅ Excel Automation (VBA) Features - 
1. Automated inventory status updates based on real-time stock vs. reorder levels 
2. Stock deduction logic triggered by sales data with a “Processed” flag to avoid repeated deductions
3. Reorder alerts shown as message boxes when the file is opened, highlighting products needing restock
4. User-friendly buttons to allow non-technical users to trigger macros easily without accessing the VBA editor

📊 Power BI Dashboard Features - 
1. KPI Cards: Total Sales, Total Orders, and Reorder Alerts
2. Interactive Slicers: Filter data by Customer, Product, and Date
3. Visuals:
- Top 5 Products by Quantity Sold (Bar Chart)
- Monthly Sales Trend (Line/Area Chart)
- Payment Status Breakdown (Donut Chart: Paid, Partial, Unpaid)
- Reorder Inventory Table: Auto-filtered to show only low-stock items

All visuals are cross-filtered and responsive to slicer or chart interactions
