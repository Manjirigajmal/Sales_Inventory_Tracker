📘 Detailed Project Description
This project presents a complete Sales & Inventory Tracking System built using Microsoft Excel (with VBA automation) and Power BI. It demonstrates how spreadsheet-driven workflows can be automated and visualized using interactive dashboards — suitable for business users, managers, and analysts.

✅ Excel Automation (VBA) Features
Automated inventory status updates based on real-time stock vs. reorder levels

Stock deduction logic triggered by sales data with a “Processed” flag to avoid repeated deductions

Reorder alerts shown as message boxes when the file is opened, highlighting products needing restock

User-friendly buttons to allow non-technical users to trigger macros easily without accessing the VBA editor

📊 Power BI Dashboard Features
KPI Cards: Total Sales, Total Orders, and Reorder Alerts

Interactive Slicers: Filter data by Customer, Product, and Date

Visuals:

Top 5 Products by Quantity Sold (Bar Chart)

Monthly Sales Trend (Line/Area Chart)

Payment Status Breakdown (Donut Chart: Paid, Partial, Unpaid)

Reorder Inventory Table: Auto-filtered to show only low-stock items

All visuals are cross-filtered and responsive to slicer or chart interactions
